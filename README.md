## Please follow the steps to run the system
First, you have to run "npm install" in the server and client, and then the server runs the file "interect.js", which uses "nodeinteract.js". The client uses "npm run dev" to run.
How to use the platform:
1. First, connect the uzheth network of the school with your own metamask.
Adding network of metamask, name: UZHETH, URL: https://vm-216.s3it.uzh.ch, ID: 702, currency symbol: UZHETH.
2. After adding, you can see your account number: copy address: 0xaB7e1c0036bBC17E78009e7ed5eE612B8b6c561E, and the export key in the account details can be exported.

Use the above address and key to register or log in. After logging in, you need to increase your own money, so you need to press add money, and the administrator needs to add money to your account. After getting money from the administrator, you could press the add money button. Money will show in your account, and then you could enter the game. After entering the game, the administrator needs to run the play-manage-first.js file with node so that the participants could play the game. After this step, the player can make a bet, and then SPIN will generate random numbers for wining and verify who win the prize.
