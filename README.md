## Please follow the steps to run the system
First, you have to run "npm install" in the server and client, and then the server runs the file "interect.js", which uses "nodeinteract.js". The client uses "npm run dev" to run.
How to use the platform:
1. First, connect the uzheth network of the school with your own metamask.
Adding network of metamask, name: UZHETH, URL: https://vm-216.s3it.uzh.ch, ID: 702, currency symbol: UZHETH.
2. After adding, you can see your account number: copy address: 0xaB7e1c0036bBC17E78009e7ed5eE612B8b6c561E, and the export key in the account details can be exported.

Use the above address and key to register or log in. After logging in, you need to increase your own money, so you need to press add money, but the administrator needs to add money to your account. After adding, press the add money button, the account will have money, and then enter the game. When entering the game, the administrator needs to run the play-manage-first.js file with node. After running, the player can make a bet, and then SPIN will generate random numbers to see if he has won the prize.
